    title: "Background",
    info: "I began my career in IT at Stryker, managing their medical equipment. Over time, my role evolved into medical sales, but I found myself drawn to a more technology-focused path. That led me to enroll in Hack Reactor's six-month immersive bootcamp, where I started my programming journey. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working as a freelance web developer while continuing to expand my skills through additional courses, including earning my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.",

    info: "All of my programming skills can be found here. Additionally, I have experience with Adobe Creative Cloud, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Lightroom, as well as other design tools like Figma. I use Figma to create website mockups for clients, providing a clear visual of the design before development. Adobe apps give me greater flexibility in styling, allowing for more creative and customized design elements.",
